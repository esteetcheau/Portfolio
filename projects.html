      <h4>2021 American CryptoFed Summer Internship: Linear Quadratic Estimator Simulation </h4>
      <p> <a href="https://www.americancryptofed.org/" target="_blank">LINK TO COMPANY WEBSITE</a> <p>
      <p>> DESCRIPTION: This internship involved using knowledge of Linear Control Theory to convert a program, which estimates a state with a Kalman Filter, from MATLAB to Python.
      The code also generates graphical plots using the matplotlib Python library to demonstrate the changes in values.<p>
      <p>> An additional task I had was to aid the corporate marketing team by using my photoshop experience to recreate the company’s brand logo, using CorelDRAW, for go-to-market.</p>
      <p>> TECHNOLOGIES USED: Python, MATLAB, CorelDRAW </p>
       <p>> ADDITIONAL NOTES: The code and generated plots are confidential to the company. </p>

      <h4>Movement of an Object in a Microgravity Environment      <a href="SimiodeExecutiveSummary.pdf" target="blank">Summary</a> </h4>
      <p>> DESCRIPTION: This project was researched and written by 3 College of San Mateo students. We were given a week to determine the range of dimensions for the smallest possible asteroid which can be used to land a probe and develop a method to land the probe on the asteroid. Additionally, we had to 
      develop a way to move the probe using a spring. The entire description of the problem (Problem B) as well as additional issues, which were to be answered in an hour and a half, can be seen at the link below.</p>

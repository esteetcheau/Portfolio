      <h4>Movement of an Object in a Microgravity Environment      <a href="SimiodeExecutiveSummary.pdf" target="blank">Summary</a> </h4>
      <p>> DESCRIPTION: This project was researched and written by 3 College of San Mateo students. We were given a week to determine the range of dimensions for the smallest possible asteroid which can be used to land a probe and develop a method to land the probe on the asteroid. Additionally, we had to 
      develop a way to move the probe using a spring. The entire description of the problem (Problem B) as well as additional issues, which were to be answered in an hour and a half, can be seen at the link below.</p>
